A simple Python script to convert data to and from something more readable by Tile Molestor (I didn't call it that, leave me alone lol)
Simply run the script and interleave to convert the ROMs to files, and de-interleave once you've made your changes.
Alongside this, included a simple Palette Flipping script so ya can export .act files from something like Palmod and flip it for ease of use

Written in Python 3.13.5
